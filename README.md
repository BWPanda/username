Username
========

Automatically generate usernames based on a token string.

If you don't want users setting their own usernames, generate them automatically
using tokens. They can be based on the user ID, email address, or custom fields
attached to user profiles.


Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules.

- Visit the configuration page under Administration > Configuration > User
  Accounts > Account Settings (admin/config/people/settings) to enable automatic
  username generation and set the pattern they're based on.

- Existing usernames can be bulk-updated by blocking and unblocking user
  accounts on the Manage User Accounts (admin/people) page.
